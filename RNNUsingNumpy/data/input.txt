Penny Lane there is a barber showing photographs
Of every head he's had the pleasure to know
And all the people that come and go stop and say "Hello"

On the corner is a banker with a motorcar
The little children laugh at him behind his back
And the banker never wears a mac in the pouring rain - very strange

Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes
There beneath the blue suburban skies I sit and meanwhile back

In Penny Lane there is a fireman with an hourglass
And in his pocket is a portrait of the Queen
He likes to keep his fire engine clean, it's a clean machine

Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes
A four of fish and finger pies in summer meanwhile back

Behind the shelter in the middle of the round-about
The pretty nurse is selling poppies from a tray
And though she feels as if she's in a play she is anyway

Penny Lane the barber shaves another customer
We see the banker sitting waiting for a trim
And the fireman rushes in from the pouring rain - very strange

Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes
There beneath the blue suburban skies I sit and meanwhile back

Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes
There beneath the blue suburban skies
Penny Lane
